NBA Transactions Data

Python scripts that collect NBA Transactions and store them as a structured dataset. CSV version available at `data/csv/transactions.csv`.

Source data is from the awesome [Pro Sports Transactions Archive](https://www.prosportstransactions.com/).

I wrote a short blog post [here](https://www.yifeihu.me/blog/nbatrades1/) about the data. Was planning on doing deeper analyses at some point at didn't have a chance to.
